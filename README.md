# Stock Market Visualization

In this project, we will be visualizing the data set of the stock market companies from 2000 to 2021.

We will then use suitable visualization and interaction techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data set to arrive at plausible conclusions and understand the stock market.

This includes:
    1. Code file to generate the visualization
    2. A report of the visualization
